    <h1>Credit Card Fraudulent Detection Project</h1>
    <p>The problem statement chosen for this project is <strong>to predict fraudulent credit card transactions with the
            help of machine learning models.</strong></p>

        <h2>Project Pipeline</h2>
        <p>The project pipeline can be briefly summarized in the following four steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Understanding:</strong> Here, we need to load the data and understand the features present
                in it. This would help us choose the features that you will need for your final model.</li>
            <li><strong>Exploratory data analytics (EDA):</strong> Normally, in this step, we need to perform univariate
                and bivariate analyses of the data, followed by feature transformations, if necessary. For the current
                data set, because Gaussian variables are used, you do not need to perform Z-scaling. However, we can
                check whether there is any skewness in the data and try to mitigate it, as it might cause problems
                during the model building phase.</li>
            <li><strong>Train/Test split:</strong> Now, we are familiar with the train/test split that you can perform
                to check the performance of your models with unseen data. Here, for validation, we can use the k-fold
                cross-validation method. We need to choose an appropriate k value so that the minority class is
                correctly represented in the test folds.</li>
            <li><strong>Model building / hyperparameter tuning:</strong> This is the final step at which we can try
                different models and fine-tune their hyperparameters until we get the desired level of performance on
                the given data set. We should try and check if we get a better model by various sampling techniques.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Model evaluation:</strong> Evaluate the models using appropriate evaluation metrics. It should
                be noted that since the data is imbalanced, it is more important to identify the fraudulent
                transactions accurately than the non-fraudulent ones. Choose an appropriate evaluation metric that
                reflects this business goal.</li>
        </ul>
